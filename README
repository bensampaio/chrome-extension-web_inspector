# WEB INSPECTOR - CHROME EXTENSION

## DESCRIPTION

Have you ever wanted to know which is that stylish font used on a certain website? Or the tex color used?

Or have you ever wanted to know the dimensions of an image without having to download it? Or a audio / video source URL?

If yes, this is the extension for you. Install Web Inspector on Chrome and on a certain page click on the extension icon. Then mouse over a certain element you are curious about and click on it. A window will be displayed around this item with information about the font used, the text color, the background color, the source URL (in case it is a multimedia item), among others. If you don't want to inspect any more element on the page just click on the extension icon again to turn it off.

Use it to inspect the Web. Hope you like it!
